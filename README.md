## Overview

ZeroAI is a decentralized solution that provides offline access to AI agents, empowering millions of users in remote or underserved areas with limited internet connectivity to access vital information and knowledge via SMS chats. It leverages Filecoin for secure storage, NFTs for content access, and integrates with The Graph and Chainlink for reliable data management and connectivity.

## Features

- **Offline AI Access:** AI agents provide responses via SMS, even without the internet.
- **Decentralized Marketplace:** Securely publish and share AI-driven content using Filecoin for storage.
- **Decentralized Storage:** Content is securely stored on Filecoin for decentralized management.
- **Secure Data Access:** Uses NFT contracts to ensure only authorized users can access and decrypt data.
- **Simple Addressing:** Access AI agents via short, memorable names (ENS names) or phone numbers.
- **Monetization for Content Creators:** Enables creators to monetize their data by publishing content on the marketplace and securing it with NFTs.
